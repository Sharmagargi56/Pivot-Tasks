Task 6: Sales Projection

For sales projection we can use forecarst sheet & separte out each fruit first then crate sheet accordingly also we can use forecast.liner formula as below.

=FORECAST(A67,C64:C66,A64:A66)

PLEASE REFER Task 6: Sales Projection SHEET



Task 7: Data Interpretation

Task 8: Anomaly Detection

Q1	50
Q3	80
IQR	30
Lower Bound	5
Upper Bound	125

we can use quartline 1,3 inter quartlineraneg along with lower & upper bound method to check.

On the basis on this we can create chart for the same.

I have attached the same practicle in excel please find there.

Task 9: Interactive Exploration

I have done please refer task4>>slicers & timeline tool use sheet 



Task 10: Data Expansion
Imagine and add sales data for two more fruits for the given dates. Then, update the PivotChart to incorporate this new data and analyze the extended dataset's trends and patterns.

by using PIVOTTABLE ANALYZE>>>CHANGE DATA SOURCE OPTION>>
we can change in data source to incorporate new changes in data & pivot table accordingly.
